# Introduction

`taskwait` checks the `taskwait` construct for the deferred target task. At the
time of writing, this hasn't been implemented in the GCC 9.2 compiler.

# Build

```bash
autoreconf -i; ./configure; make; make check; sudo make install;
```

`make check` has been tested on OCuLUS (with OpenCCS) and P53s (without OpenCCS).
