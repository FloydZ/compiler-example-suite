# Introduction

`dataTransRate` gives the data transfer rate (in MB/sec) from `src` to `dst`.

The possible situations are:

* h2h: `src` = host  and `dst` = host
* h2a: `src` = host  and `dst` = accel
* a2a: `src` = accel and `dst` = accel

# Usage

```bash
export CUDA_LAUNCH_BLOCKING 1
dataTransRate
```
