# Activation of Accelerator

`omp_get_num_devices()` constantly returns 0, if accelerator(s) have not been
activated by an OpenMP directive, even though there are accelerator(s) in the
computing system. See `02_dataTransRate`.

NOTE: This bug has been fixed in Clang 11. But the data transfer rate within
an accelerator's DRAM, e.g. `a2a`, is still much lower than our expectation.
